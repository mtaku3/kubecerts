## Directory Structure Guidelines

⚠️ **IMPORTANT - Directory Structure Changes**

**ALWAYS ASK BEFORE MODIFYING DIRECTORY STRUCTURE**

Do not change the directory structure on your own decision. Always ask the user for confirmation before:
- Moving files between directories
- Creating new directories 
- Removing directories
- Reorganizing package structure

The user expects explicit control over how the codebase is organized.

## Code Modification Guidelines

⚠️ **IMPORTANT - Function and Type Additions**

**ALWAYS ASK BEFORE ADDING NEW FUNCTIONS OR TYPES**

If you need to add additional functions or types other than what the user has told you to implement, ask the user before you actually add them. Include:
- **Purpose**: What the function/type is intended to do
- **Responsibility**: What role it plays in the system
- **Justification**: Why it's needed for the current task

Do not proactively add helper functions, utility types, or convenience methods without explicit user approval.
